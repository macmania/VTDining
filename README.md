VTDining

Provides nutritional data information from the Virginia Tech dining facility (http://foodpro.dsa.vt.edu/FPMobile/location.asp) to the user with a better UI/UX design. 

This application enables the user to solve the particular problems: 
	- Figure out the nutritional menu of the current open dining facilities 
	- Save a particular menu options to the user's profile (using facebook or twitter's credentials or to other types of dietary sites)
	- enables the user to save the food that they consume to a particular site that helps track their food consumption. 

Back-end service: Mongo-powered + digital ocean. 

Open source, designers are welcome on board. Shoot me an email jojofabe@vt.edu
